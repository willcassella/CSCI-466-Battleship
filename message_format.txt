We used the same format as described in the problem - Client sends an HTTP POST request with "x={X}&y={Y}" as arguments, and the server
returns "hit={0/1}[&sink={C/R/B/D/S}]" if the request was formatted correctly and identifies a new tile, BAD REQUEST if the request doesn't
contain an x/y argument and GONE if the request identifies a tile that has already been hit.

The serialization format for the game identifies the layout of the board, and which ships have been sunk. It works with the layout described in the
assignment, and introduces the values 'X' (for ship tiles that have been hit, but the ship type is unknown) and '?' for unidentified tiles.
